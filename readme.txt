NO CD CHECK - PROPELLERHEAD REBIRTH 338 V201 By THEKIKGEN
---------------------------------------------------------

RB-338 is now a freeware, but it still asks for the CD image to be present and it's quite annoying.
With this small not intrusive patch, you do not need anymore to launch the cd image before using RB-338.

1/ Mount CD image and install Rebirth RB-338 on your computer 
1/ Copy RB20FUL.DAT & RB20UPD.DAT  to the root of a fixed hardisk or a usb key that will be permanently available
2/ Copy all files to the "x:\Rebirth RB-338" install directory (x being your disk drive letter)
2/ Use rblaunch.bat to launch RB-338 without cd check.
3/ Do not use compatibility mode for all windows versions (uncheck the compatibility checkbox in files properties)

Note, that the Windows Help format used by Rebirth is not supported anymore. When you install and use Rebirth for the first time,
an Help window is shown, and the application crashes. The patch takes care of that and applying it will not show the help window.
Tested and working on Windows 11.

Thanks to Propellerhead Software to made this a freeware.

Have fun !
